## üìå Problem Statement
In shared living situations, roommates often face challenges in managing and splitting common expenses fairly. Without a clear system, misunderstandings and disputes over who paid what can arise. Current methods of expense tracking, such as manual calculations or simple spreadsheets, are inefficient, error-prone, and lack transparency. This project addresses the need for an easy-to-use, automated solution to track and split expenses in shared living arrangements.
